Project: Weather Dashboard
Objective: Create a responsive weather dashboard that displays the current weather and a 5-day forecast for a city entered by the user.
Use the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.
Requirements:
    HTML Structure:
        Use semantic HTML5 tags to structure the dashboard.
        Include an input field for users to type the name of the city.
        Display areas for current weather and the 5-day forecast.
    Bootstrap Integration:
        Utilize Bootstrap for the dashboard layout and components.
        Use cards to display the weather forecast for each day.
        Implement a responsive design that looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
    JavaScript:
        Use JavaScript to add interactivity to the dashboard.
        Fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on the city entered by the user.
        Dynamically update the UI with the fetched data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and an icon representing the weather conditions.
        Save the user's last searched city in local storage and provide an option to view it again when they return to the dashboard.
Deliverables:
    Source code including HTML, CSS (if any custom styling is used), and JavaScript files.
    A README file with instructions on how to set up and use the weather dashboard, including obtaining an API key from OpenWeatherMap.
Learning Outcomes:
    Basic understanding of working with APIs to fetch and display data.
    Enhancing user interface design with Bootstrap for a professional and polished look.
    Advanced JavaScript techniques for asynchronous data retrieval, local storage handling, and DOM manipulation.
